# Movie-Recommendation_System

Designed a Collaborative Filtering Recommender (CFR) system to recommend movies.

The collaborative filtering approach considers only user preferences and does not take into account the features or contents of the items (books or movies) being recommended. In this project, in order to recommend movies I have used a large set of users preferences towards the movies from a publicly available movie rating dataset.

All the datasets are added in the repo.
